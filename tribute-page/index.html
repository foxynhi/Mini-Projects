        <h2 class='center'>Einstein's scientific career</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>1896</b> - At the age of 17, Einstein renounced his German citizenship and enrolled in the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich to study physics and mathematics.</li>
          <li><b>1900</b> - He graduated from Swiss Federal Polytechnic. After two years of searching, he got a job at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.</li>
          <li><b>1905</b> - This year is often referred to as his "Annus Mirabilis" or "miracle year". While still working at the patent office, he published four groundbreaking papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mcÂ²) in the "Annalen der Physik", one of the best-known physics journals.</li>
          <li><b>1908</b> - Einstein was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern.</li>
          <li><b>1909</b> - He quit the patent office and was employed as a professor of physics at the University of Zurich.</li>
          <li><b>1911</b> - Einstein became a full professor at the Charles University in Prague.</li>
          <li><b>1912</b> - He returned to the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich as a professor.</li>
          <li><b>1914</b> - Einstein was appointed as director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin. He also became a professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin and a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.</li>
          <li><b>1915</b> - He presented the field equations of general relativity to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.</li>
          <li><b>1919</b> - British astronomer Arthur Eddington confirmed Einstein's theory of general relativity through observations during a solar eclipse. This led to Einstein's worldwide fame.</li>
          <li><b>1921</b> - Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.</li>
          <li><b>1933</b> - With the rise of the Nazis in Germany, Einstein left Germany for the United States. He accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he remained until his retirement in 1945.</li>
          <li><b>1955</b> - On April 18, Einstein passed away in Princeton.</li>
        </ul>
